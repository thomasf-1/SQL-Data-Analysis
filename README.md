# Video Game Sales Data Analysis in SQL

In this project, I am working with video game sales data from a Kaggle data set. I split the original data set into two tables in order to work with JOIN queries. 

The database contains two tables: **_gamesalesproject1_**  and **_gamesreviewsdata_** . There are 19,600 rows in this dataset. 

**_gamesalesproject1_** has 6 columns:

**game** (The name of the video game)

**platform** (Gaming Platform)

**publisher** (Game Publisher)

**developer** (Game Developer)

**games_sold** (Number of games sold in millions)

**year** (Release year)


<br> <br>

**_gamesreviewsdata_** has 3 columns:

**game**(The name of the video game)

**critic_score** (Critic score according to Metacritic)

**user_score** (User score according to Metacritic)

I'll use SQL in this project  to explore and analyze the data set. Concepts used will be JOINS, set theories such as INTERCEPT, common table expressions, and subqueries.
